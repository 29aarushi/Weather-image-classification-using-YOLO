### Weather-image-classification-using-YOLO

#Project Overview
This project is designed to classify weather conditions in images using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, Version 8) model. YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art object detection model known for its speed and accuracy. In this project, we train YOLOv8 to recognize various weather conditions, such as sunny, cloudy, rainy, and snowy, within images.
